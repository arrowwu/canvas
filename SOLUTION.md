# Solution

### render the canvas 

### draw images on the canvas

### write functions to listen to mouse event and then re-draw the images

### Add the logic so that the image won't be dragged out of the canvas boundry

### Add the logic so that the image that is being clicked/dragged will be on the top layer

### in terms of persisting state on refresh, we can either store images arrays to sessionStorage/localstorage or do api call to update the backend
